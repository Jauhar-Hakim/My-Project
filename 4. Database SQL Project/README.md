# Database SQL Project
Collaborating with Felicia, Jasmine Husna Sanditya, Joan Bidadari Annandale, and Nicholas Sky Salvatio, we created a database for the game development team system. The process includes CRUD (Create Read Update Delete) and the simulated use of JOIN and conditionals WHERE functions.

We use MySQL, Python, and SQLite for the process of making this database. PPT 1 contain the explanation of ER diagram and PPT 2 contain the explanation of CRUD process in database for the game development team system.
